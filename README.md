# chromaSwap
Transparent JPEGs right there in your web browser!

Just a fun little hack that replaces the contents of `<canvas>` element with an image and replaces a colour with the alpha
channel so you can kind of almost use JPEGs as if they had a transparent background, like a chromakey! Other image formats work too.

It's a bit like the Gimps *color to alpha* in javascript.

Have a look at the index.html file to get an idea of how to use it. It's also a module so you can `import` if you want to.

There's a demo at https://chromaswap.surge.sh
